# Code Quality Report

In the file proj/code_quality_report.md, your should explain why you think you have written good code and why you think that the code is good! You can go about this in any way that you like that is helpful to the reviewer. Helpful saves time, meaning that blanket statements such as “just look at all the code” are not good enough (discussing each function individually also would not save time). 

You should have consistently good quality meaning that you cannot concentrate on code quality in just a few places, point to them as good examples in the report, and expect to pass.

This file, together with the GitHub issue log, should convince the examiner that you pass Y65.
