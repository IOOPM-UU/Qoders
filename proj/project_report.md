# 3 Process   
## 3.1 Inception
Hur många gånger drömde du att du gjort massa jobb när du egentligen inte gjort något alls?:O
In this section, discuss choice of process, how you went about learning the process, how you went about implementing the process.

## 3.2 Implementation
- what you actually implemented of the process
- strengths and weaknesses with your implementation of your chosen process
- what you would do differently if you were to start over tomorrow
- what successes you would attempt to repeat if you were to start over tomorrow
- how plans were made, key plans, and to what extent your plans were followed
- how decision making happened, key decisions, and whether they were followed
- how did you attack the Christmas break problem with planning?
# 4 Use of Tools

#### What tools you used in the project and how were they used?
For this project our main tools to have been used has been Visual Studio Code for an easy programming experience,
    Github desktop for an easy UI that helps us efficiently do pull, push, merge and other git commands while also navigating our different branches, Trello in order to organize our work load and keep track of whos doing what and how far along we are in the project, 
    Discord as our main means of communication as it provides an intuitive UI and can be combined with built in bots that automatically provides us with up-to-date information from our Github repository.
