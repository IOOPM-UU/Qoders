# 3 Process   
## 3.1 Inception
Hur många gånger drömde du att du gjort massa jobb när du egentligen inte gjort något alls?:O
In this section, discuss choice of process, how you went about learning the process, how you went about implementing the process.

## 3.2 Implementation
- what you actually implemented of the process
- strengths and weaknesses with your implementation of your chosen process
- what you would do differently if you were to start over tomorrow
- what successes you would attempt to repeat if you were to start over tomorrow
- how plans were made, key plans, and to what extent your plans were followed
- how decision making happened, key decisions, and whether they were followed
- how did you attack the Christmas break problem with planning?
# 4 Use of Tools

#### What tools you used in the project and how were they used?
For this project our main tools to have been used has been:
 - Visual Studio Code for an easy programming experience,
-  Github desktop for an easy UI that helps us efficiently do pull, push, merge and other git commands while also navigating our different branches, 
- Trello in order to organize our work load and keep track of whos doing what and how far along we are in the project, 
- Discord as our main means of communication as it provides an intuitive UI and can be combined with built in bots that automatically provides us with up-to-date information from our Github repository. 
- Valgrind GDB cov 

#### Were you missing any tools?
No.
#### What tools would you rather not use in the future?
We do not believe in discontinuing usage of specific tools as it shows of poor character. 


# 5 Communication, Cooperation and Coordination   

Communication during this project has worked very well, we started by creating a discord server which was used as our main form of communication and where we've kept the mood light and friendly. Communication with people outside the team has not been organized other than our two meetings with our "Coach", the coach meetings where done simply by sending out an email and deciding on a good date. 
In regards to cooperation and coordination; we decided on our first group meeting that we would split the project into smaller tickets, these tickets would then be spread out amongst smaller groups of two within the project group. By doing this we could isolate problems to specific people and allow everyone to feel responsible for specific aspects of this project. Using Trello it also allowed us to send more people to places where it was needed. Usually when something took a bit longer someone else was quicker, it balanced out nicely. We also assigned one member to be "_Tech support_", he was responsible for accepting pull requests and was also the one managing the makefile and git in general. Giving this task to one specific person also ensured that we had both a chain of command and a structure which allowed for help to be given and had. 
During the """""""break"""""""" we all knew the tasks we had and so we singled out two days on which all communication, cooperation and coordination were to happen. This allowed us to work independently and yet confirm progress or stalling in a relevant way. 

- the communication between team members and with people outside the team
- the cooperation between team members
- the coordination between team members with respect to technical tasks
- how did you deal with team members that were demotivated, angry, stressed about things outside of the project?
- how did you handle communication, cooperation and coordination during the break?
- lessons learned

# 6 Work Breakdown Structure

- what sprints you planned for and what the time plan for the sprints were    
- how the programming tasks were divided, distributed, carried out, load-balanced, etc. – if you used pair programming how did that go? Did you use it for everything?
- what were the actual tasks
- did you manage to load-balance the workload so that no one was overwhelmed, how/why not?
- were tasks of equal sizes or not, and how you handled if they were not
- your thoughts on how does one estimate how much time a task will take

# 7 Reflection
