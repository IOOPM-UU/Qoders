# 3 Process   
## 3.1 Inception
<!-- Hur många gånger drömde du att du gjort massa jobb när du egentligen inte gjort något alls?:O -->
<!-- TODO: -->
In this section, discuss choice of process, how you went about learning the process, how you went about implementing the process.

## 3.2 Implementation
<!-- TODO: -->
- what you actually implemented of the process
- strengths and weaknesses with your implementation of your chosen process
- what you would do differently if you were to start over tomorrow
- what successes you would attempt to repeat if you were to start over tomorrow
- how plans were made, key plans, and to what extent your plans were followed
- how decision making happened, key decisions, and whether they were followed
- how did you attack the Christmas break problem with planning?
# 4 Use of Tools

#### What tools you used in the project and how were they used?
For this project our main tools has been:
- **Visual Studio Code** for an easy programming experience
- **Visual Studio Live Share** for easy collaboration when working and coding together
-  **Github desktop** for an easy UI that helps us efficiently do pull, push, merge and other git commands while also navigating our different branches
- **Trello** in order to organize our work load and keep track of whos doing what and how far along we are in the project
- **Discord** as our main means of communication as it provides an intuitive UI and can be combined with built in bots that automatically provides us with up-to-date information from our Github repository. 
- **Valgrind** to test our code for memory leaks
- **GDB** as our main debugging tool
- **gcov** in order to give confidence in overall code coverage on different branches

#### Were you missing any tools?
No.
#### What tools would you rather not use in the future?
We do not believe in discontinued usage of specific tools as it shows of poor character. 


# 5 Communication, Cooperation and Coordination   

Communication during this project has worked very well, we started by creating a discord server which was used as our main form of communication and where we've kept the mood light and friendly. Communication with people outside the team has not been organized other than our three meetings with our "Coach", the coach meetings where done simply by sending out an email and deciding on a good date. 

In regards to cooperation and coordination; we decided on our first group meeting that we would split the project into smaller tickets, these tickets would then be spread out amongst smaller groups of two within the project group. By doing this we could isolate problems to specific people and allow everyone to feel responsible for specific aspects of this project. Using Trello it also allowed us to send more people to places where it was needed. Usually when something took a bit longer someone else was quicker, it balanced out nicely. We also assigned one member to be "_Tech support_", he was responsible for accepting pull requests and was also the one managing the makefile and git in general. Giving this task to one specific person also ensured that we had both a chain of command and a structure which allowed for help to be given and had. 

During the "break" we all knew the tasks we had and so we singled out two days on which all communication, cooperation and coordination were to happen. This allowed us to work independently and yet confirm progress or stalling in a relevant way. 

<!-- - the communication between team members and with people outside the team
- the cooperation between team members
- the coordination between team members with respect to technical tasks
- how did you handle communication, cooperation and coordination during the break? -->
<!-- TODO: -->
- how did you deal with team members that were demotivated, angry, stressed about things outside of the project?
- lessons learned

# 6 Work Breakdown Structure
<!-- FIXME: -->
- what sprints you planned for and what the time plan for the sprints were    
- how the programming tasks were divided, distributed, carried out, load-balanced, etc. – if you used pair programming how did that go? Did you use it for everything?
- what were the actual tasks
Ticket 1
Ticket 2
Ticket 3
Ticket 4
Ticket 5
Reports

- did you manage to load-balance the workload so that no one was overwhelmed, how/why not?
We used pair programming and made our best to divide the project into smaller tickets and subtasks using Trello. This allowed us to keep track of progress and ensuring that if someone was falling behind with others finishing early we could easily intervene and provide needed support.  
- were tasks of equal sizes or not, and how you handled if they were not
It is difficult to assess the "size" of tasks that are different in nature and difference in skill and capability leads to difference in what is "equal". Because of this Trello was frequently used to track progress but mostly we relied on each other to give everyone a heads up if one was falling behind or quickly succeeding with given task.
- your thoughts on how does one estimate how much time a task will take

# 7 Reflection

    How confident you are that have actually implemented the right thing (why, how, etc.)
    We feel confident that what we delivered has been implemented in the correct way as we can achieve the purpose of the task at hand, however 

    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your process and provide justification for that number
    5, we feel that our process has worked well despite us feeling stressed in the last days before the presentation struggling to finish all aspects of the project. We believe the process itself has worked fine but we could improve on being more strict in following the process itself. 

    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your delivered product and provide justification for that number
    5, 

    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your quality assurance and provide justification for that number
    6, our quality assurance worked by having someone that did not write the code(preferably the tech lead) examine the pull requests and then after review push it to the master branch, we believe this was a good system and allowed us to find each others errors efficiently. Other than using a tech lead and pull requests we also worked a lot with unit testing to ensure our quality. 

    what does the team consider its biggest win?
    Collaboration was a big win for us as we managed to split the project into smaller tasks which were then delegated, spread across the group. This allowed us to efficiently have a good idea of what was supposed to be done and who was supposed to do what. 

    what does the team consider its biggest fail?
    The biggest fail may have been to not be more strict on when and what would be finished, discovering that parts we believed to be finished was in fact not.
