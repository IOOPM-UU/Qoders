# Individual Reflections

<!-- Every project member shall write a short self reflection (about 1500–3000 characters. Note – all character counts in this document are to be interpreted as “as output by the wc command”) about their performance. What are your strengths and weaknesses in a project? What traits should you enhance, and what do you need to improve?

All individual reflections go into a separate section of the file proj/individual_reflections.md. Be sure to state your name in the beginning of your part.

This file should convince the examiner that each team member passes Y67.


Verkar som att alla ska skriva i samma dokument. 
    Så man skriver ett "avsnitt" per person i detta dokumet. -->


### Simon Gebre Yohannes 
- How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?

I believe that I function quite well as someone that gets the group motivated and do the work. Whenever you work in groups where you don’t necessarily know everyone it’s easy to feel unsure and wary of even the most basic things: scheduling a meeting with everyone is a great example of this.

The way that I function in a group are in most ways also my strengths. By being able to motivate the group to start the project we were able to get a good start in the beginning whilst making everyone within the group feel as though they had something to do. As a group member I also feel like I’m quite good at discussing concepts or at least start conversations regarding something I’m not sure about. When it comes to my weaknesses: I feel like I’m not quite good at actually making people keep their deadlines and “make” people work. Since I was the one to divide the work and organize meetings and such I should have taken steps towards making sure that people did their work in a timely manner. 

- How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?

I should have been even more outspoken regarding parts of the project I felt were unclear as well as working closer to those whose tasks were intertwined with mine. Most of the times I’ve felt it has been alright to work independently, this time however, I would have been a lot more effective if I did not assume that all parts would come together seamlessly whenever we would merge our work.

- What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?

I’m mainly motivated by passing this course and actually learning something that has real life use cases. This project (for me) really deep dives into the c-language which is a great experience and learning opportunity which keeps me motivated since whatever I learn now will be useful later in life.

- How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produces my estimations?

I’m bad at approximating how long it takes for me to program tasks. I haven’t thought too much about how long something will take to do, but rather assume that it might take a while and if I’m done sooner then that's great.

- Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll? What role do I want to play in a team?

I’m quite flexible regarding what role I take. I feel like it is more important that a group focuses on an individual's strengths rather than what role people want. For this project I assumed a pseudo organizer/programmer role. I don’t feel like I take on a certain role, it varies depending on the group I’m in.

- Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam? Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.

I’ve definitely enjoyed working in a group. I do learn programming better when I do it with someone else and we speak about it as well as the problem at hand. 

- Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?

There weren’t any problems logging how much time I spent on the project.

- “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

Biggest win: Greatly improved the test coverage.

Biggest fail: For some reason I didn’t think of the fact that I could use functions that were already created in linked.c and started to write everything myself again.


### Josias Roeland

- How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?

I believe I funciton quite well in a team, since I am someone who is very social and can quite easily talk to anyone. I am someone who often breaks the ice which can be pretty important when working with new people like in this project. Furthermore, I believe some streghts of mine are that I often create some structure and keeps everyone more or less on the same page. A great example of this is in meetings, were I often without me really thinking of it becomes the one who does most and the talkng and make sure we do not steer to far of track. I am often the one who asks everyone were their at and makes sure the meeting does not drag on to long just discussing useless things or things not everyone in the group needs to discuss. 

When it comes to my weaknesses, I believe I am not very good at making sure everyone is on the same page code wise. I feel like I am somewhat capable of making sure everyone is working toghether towards the same goal but think I need to improve on making sure we all get there the same way. So for example knowing more in detail what we all are doing and more importantly how so there are less clashes later down the line.


- How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?

I feel like I should have pushed more on working together at the same time instead of independently. Most of the time, working independently works perfectly fine, maybe even better than working together, but I realised I can mean we all slowly drift away from eachother implementation wise. This lead during the project that the integration part of the project took a lot longer than expected and made the progress take a screeching halt.

- What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?

What motivates me is learning new things and feeling like I am contantly imporving. What demotivates me is the opposite, feeling like I am not getting anything from doing something. This means I like to switch between working on things when I get stuck on something to keep moving forward.

- How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produce my estimations?

I believe I am relatively decent at estimating how long a task will take. The only thing I rely on in experience which meant I got better and better at estimating how long things would take the further into the project we got.

- What role do I want to play in a team?

I do not necessary "want" any role in a team. I want to do what I feel most useful doing as well as doing what the teams needs me to do. I want to let everyone play to their streghts so if someone else is a lot better at something than me I have no problem letting them do it. I want the role that is going to benefit the team most.

- Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll?

I function quite well in a team I would say. I can work with just about anyone and am not super picky in what I work with. As I said earlier am I often the one taking the floor and taking some charge in meetings and so on since I have an easy time talking with people.

- Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam?

I like working alone since it often takes a lot more coordination to do the same thing with other people as well as you having to understand someones logic and wise versa. However, when the task is big enough that everyone can sort of have their own part I find it much more enjoyable working in a group. In this case you can easily ask for help and thoughts while still having that freedom of working more independantly.

- Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.

Strictly coding, I feel like I have not leared anything new. However I feel like I have leared alot more about how C works as well as how the computers memory works. The biggest thing however I have leared has to be working in a largerer group on a larger project. It was a compeletly diffrent experience than working with a partner like earlier dureing the course.

- Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?

It has gone suprisingly well. I usually struggle with remebering to write anything until it is to late, but this time I rememberd eveytime. I turns out to be a very nice way of keeping track of what you actually did that day and helps you keep track of your progress.

- “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

Biggest Fail: Our coordination. Our coordination was what eventually lead to us not being able to compeletly finsish the project.

Biggest Win: I was able to solve the issue of our pointer to allocated memory pointing to the wrong part. It was a problem I am proud of understanding and solving. I was also able to catch it before it became a really nasty problem which probably saves a lot of time.


### Hector Bergman

In the project I felt as if I worked a lot more diligently towards the end than in the beginning. Part of it lies of course in the fact that I had a lot more on my plate in the start, between christmas, inlupp4 and the math exam there was a lot of other things taking up my time while the project maybe ended up a bit on the backburner, but at the same time part of it also lies in that I get a bit demotivated in the start when you haven't fully gotten into the project and aren't quite sure what the endgoal is. But once I truly got into it I worked extremely hard.

In the team I mostly just tried to work on what I considered relevant to work on in that moment, but I also called the shots sometimes when I felt it was needed. I think with larger groups like we were now I perform slightly worse than when I'm alone but in a smaller group of 2-3 the performance is overall better.

During the project I think the overall amount learn was less than in the rest of the course. TAs were not as available as they were during the rest of the course when I feel that talking to them is when I learned the most. Not to say that this was all for nothing, I learned a lot about what works and especially what doesn't work when working in a group.

Logging the time spent went fine, missed a few days where I logged it after-the-fact. Might have missed a day or two though unfortunately.

Biggest Fail:
The cleanup() function overall was just a pain through and through and caused many headaches. I'm not sure how it could have been done better but something in there went wrong.

Biggest Win:
I don't have a specific 'Biggest Win' but I think towards the end I called a lot of shots for the group that steered us on the correct path instead of being stuck on things that might have ended up being unnecessary


### Alexander Liberman

- How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?

I would say that I function pretty well in a team by taking more of a supportive role where I can float between tasks and help out where I'm needed, while still having my own tasks. I would say my strengths are that I can adapt to new situations, allowing me to get situated with issues and new obstacles quickly by setting up a plan of action on the fly. My weaknesses is that I struggle with focusing on one thing, which is why I would say the 'floating' role suits me. 

- How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?

I think what I can do to work better in a team is be more proactive, instead of waiting for people to ask me for help, i should sit down with each member of the group and go over their parts of the project together, that way we can clear up issues and misunderstandings earlier.

- What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?

I am motivated when there is a clear structure. Knowing what to do, when to do it and in what order to do things makes it alot easier for me to be motivated, since the line from start to finish is clear and I get a sense of accomplishment when finishing a task. I get demotivated by lack of communication and serial procastrination. I love helping out, helping others motivates me, and if a member were to not do their part or not communicate a need for help, I would be demotivated instead. 

- How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produce my estimations?

I usually estimate how long a task will take by trying to figure out how much I know and how much I don't know in it. Then i break the task down into research and execution. The research part is usually faster than the exectuion, but is still worth taking into account. Thereafter I usually factor in what needs to be done, what could go wrong and how long it would take me to fix it. If certain parts of the task are remenisent of past tasks, I can usually get through them quickly, while brand new tasks require me to come up with a plan of action in my head before I can execute it. 

- What role do I want to play in a team?

I would say I play either a leading or supporting role in a team, either by making decisions on when and how things should be done or helping other group members with their parts. 

- Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll?

While I prefer the leading/supporting role I am flexible with what I do, if I'm not in one of those roles I usually work on tasks I find challenging or interesting. 

- Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam?

I learn best by first reading or doing something and then explaining it to someone. I would say working in a group helps me understand and learn more than if I were to work alone. Working in a group also gives me insentive to put in the time I need, as I feel like I'm letting the team down if I don't get my part done. 

- Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.

I would say I have learned more during the lab sessions when it comes to programming itself and the project has been a way of putting what I learned into practice. I would say I have gotten experience in working with a larger team which is something I haven't done before in a programming environment.

- Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?

There haven't been any issues with my logging of time, other than it being tricky to estimate how much time I've put into helping people with their respective problems.

- “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

Biggest fail - Not realizing that we would have to create new datastructures (or rename old ones) in the integration of the project into inlupp 2 as we would need to redefine how hash_tables and linked_lists are allocated using our version rather than malloc/calloc and free. 

Biggest win - 

### Martin Cavallin

- How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?

I think personally that I am good at working together with people and generally social. I think my strengths are that I can be straightforward and solution oriented 
while not being too bitterly serious at solving the task. Seriousness and pleasantness must co-exist during processes that are over a course of a longer period. I believe my weaknesses are that I can be ambitious in regards to time and sometimes I can derail into topics that may not be relevant if respons is given to said topic. 

- How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?

I believe I can attempt to seek more problems and always check if someone needs to be off-loaded with tasks they are struggling with. 

- What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?

I am motivated by progress and learning new things but demotivated by things I have a hard time justifying. I stay motivated in a project by finding angles where I can 
see interesting aspects of it and by reminding me its for a long-term cause I do it. 

- How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produces my estimations?

I have not yet gotten to a level where I can accurately estimate tasks, it feels like I mostly "eye-ball" it without actually having a set process to concretely evaluate what a realistic time line will be, this is a skill I wish to improve. 

- Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll? What role do I want to play in a team?

I want to play a role where I can motivate my members and keep the spirit high while also contributing where I see best fit. I believe I can have rational ideas as to how something can be solved in the most efficient way. I wish to play a role where I can perform and help teammates as much as possible. 

- Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam? Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.

I definitely prefer to work as a group, I feel like most "lifehacks" I know in coding comes from working with other people. Other perspectives is just good no matter what field of life we are talking, especially true for coding as there are so many ways to do different things which leads to people having different solutions and thoughts about the same things.  

- Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?

It has worked but I can become better at remembering to do it after every session, now it feels like it has been done more sporadically than what one would hope. For example times when one starts working on the project without planning it before hand, you kind of forget that you are doing the work. 

- “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

Biggest fail: I believe the execution of the planning became a fail in terms of coordination. 
Biggest win: I put in great effort into the reports and coordinated what was needed for many aspects in terms of what data and information was needed.
