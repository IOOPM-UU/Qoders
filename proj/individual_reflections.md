# Individual Reflections

Every project member shall write a short self reflection (about 1500–3000 characters. Note – all character counts in this document are to be interpreted as “as output by the wc command”) about their performance. What are your strengths and weaknesses in a project? What traits should you enhance, and what do you need to improve?

All individual reflections go into a separate section of the file proj/individual_reflections.md. Be sure to state your name in the beginning of your part.

This file should convince the examiner that each team member passes Y67.


Verkar som att alla ska skriva i samma dokument. 
    Så man skriver ett "avsnitt" per person i detta dokumet.
