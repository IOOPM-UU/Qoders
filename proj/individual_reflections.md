# Individual Reflections

Every project member shall write a short self reflection (about 1500–3000 characters. Note – all character counts in this document are to be interpreted as “as output by the wc command”) about their performance. What are your strengths and weaknesses in a project? What traits should you enhance, and what do you need to improve?

All individual reflections go into a separate section of the file proj/individual_reflections.md. Be sure to state your name in the beginning of your part.

This file should convince the examiner that each team member passes Y67.


Verkar som att alla ska skriva i samma dokument. 
    Så man skriver ett "avsnitt" per person i detta dokumet.

In the project I felt as if I worked a lot more diligently towards the end than in the beginning. Part of it lies of course in the fact that I had a lot more on my plate in the start, between christmas, inlupp4 and the math exam there was a lot of other things taking up my time while the project maybe ended up a bit on the backburner, but at the same time part of it also lies in that I get a bit demotivated in the start when you haven't fully gotten into the project and aren't quite sure what the endgoal is. But once I truly got into it I worked extremely hard.

In the team I mostly just tried to work on what I considered relevant to work on in that moment, but I also called the shots sometimes when I felt it was needed. I think with larger groups like we were now I perform slightly worse than when I'm alone but in a smaller group of 2-3 the performance is overall better.

During the project I think the overall amount learn was less than in the rest of the course. TAs were not as available as they were during the rest of the course when I feel that talking to them is when I learned the most. Not to say that this was all for nothing, I learned a lot about what works and especially what doesn't work when working in a group.

Logging the time spent went fine, missed a few days where I logged it after-the-fact. Might have missed a day or two though unfortunately.

Biggest Fail:
The cleanup() function overall was just a pain through and through and caused many headaches. I'm not sure how it could have been done better but something in there went wrong.

Biggest Win:
I don't have a specific 'Biggest Win' but I think towards the end I called a lot of shots for the group that steered us on the correct path instead of being stuck on things that might have ended up being unnecessary
